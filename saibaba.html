            <h5><i>About Sai Baba</i></h5>
                <pre><i>Shirdi Sai Baba, was an Indian spiritual guru who was regarded by his devotees as a saint, fakir, and satguru, according to their 
individual proclivities and beliefs. He was revered by both his Hindu and Muslim devotees, and it was uncertain if he was a Hindu 
or a Muslim. This, however, was of no consequence to Sai Baba. He stressed the importance of surrender to the true Satguru or 
Murshid, who, having trod the path to divine consciousness, will lead the disciple through the jungle of spiritual training. 
Sai Baba is worshipped by people around the world. He had no love for perishable things and his sole concern was realization of the 
self. He gave no distinction based on religion or caste. Sai Baba’s teaching combined elements of Hinduism and Islam, he gave the 
Hindu name Dwarakamayi to the mosque in which he lived, practiced Muslim rituals, taught using words and figures that drew from 
both traditions, and was buried in Shirdi. 
One of his well known epigrams, <b>“Sabka Malik Ek”</b>, is associated with Hinduism and Islam. 
He also said, <b>“Trust in me and your prayer shall be answered.”</b>
He always uttered <b>“Allah Malik”</b>.</i></pre>
            <h5><i>My Experience with Sai Baba</i></h5>
                 <pre>From birth my mother brought me up in devotional way, by teaching all the principles and morals. Since I am 
5 year old i started going to baba temple near my house. My relation with Baba started at that time. As i pray him daily i never 
faced any difficulties. I first came to sai nilayam when i am  17 years old, by entering into sai nilayam my life took a drastic 
changewhich i even cant believe till date. Baba changed my entire life. Our elders says even god wishes us good, it will happen and 
expressedin the form of pure soul human being that is my prasanna aunty and sastri uncle. My bond with them is 4 years but i always 
feel i am with them from very long time. I feel like they my god given parents and well wishers. The care and affection they show
towards is unimaginable. When i am 18 years old, me and my parents are totally in confusion about my career and further education.
Our prayers to Baba fullfilled and aunty-uncle shown me a way to go forward. By God grace and aunty-uncle blessings i got seat in 
MS RAMAIAH UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES, Bangalore. My education totally changed in a flash. Not only in academics even i read 
baba satcharita, hanuman story, ramdev baba story, Durgadevi slogans with all the blessings of aunty. I think if aunty is not there
i will never gain this spiritual knowledge in my lifetime. Every time after reading those spiritual stories my mind and heart stays 
calm and peace. I promise today on this auspicious day of baba 11th annivasary in sai nilayam i will never leave baba and aunty.
I want to conclude by saying THANK YOU ! baba and aunty-uncle for everything, in future whatever position i am in its all because 
of you three. Om sai ram 🙏🏻 </pre>
                
              <h5><i>Baba beautiful words</i></h5>
                  <pre><b>   
            “Anger, ego, jealousy are the biggest diseases. Keep yourself aloof from these three diseases.” 
                    
            “Only that which is got by hard effort will yield lasting benefit.”

            “Do not use poisonous words against anyone, for words wound more fatally than even arrows.” 
                  </b></pre>
